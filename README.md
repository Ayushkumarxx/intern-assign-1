# Itinerary Maker for Internship

A React-based web application built to help users (interns) create and manage their internship itineraries efficiently. This app utilizes React, Tailwind CSS for styling, and the Gemini API to fetch relevant data and update the UI accordingly. The project includes a fully responsive UI with support for both dark and light modes. The goal was to implement the UI first, integrate API calls, and ensure good coding practices.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a tool for interns to manage their internship tasks and schedules in a simple yet functional way. The application allows users to:

- Switch between light and dark modes seamlessly.
- Fetch and display itinerary data using the Gemini API.
- Update the UI with real-time data.
- Be fully responsive and user-friendly on various screen sizes.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Gemini API**: For fetching data related to internships and creating personalized itineraries.
- **Netlify**: Deployed the app for live use.
- **GitHub**: Code repository for version control and collaboration.

### Features Implemented

- **Dark and Light Modes**: The app is equipped with a toggle to switch between light and dark modes, providing a better user experience based on the time of day or personal preference.
- **Gemini API Integration**: The application successfully fetches data from the Gemini API and updates the UI dynamically.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring that the application is responsive and works on all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- **Fast Deployment**: Code was uploaded to GitHub and deployed on Netlify in less than a day.

### Key Goals Achieved

- Completed the UI part with both dark and light modes.
- Integrated the Gemini API to fetch and update itinerary data.
- Practiced good coding standards, including component-based architecture, modular CSS, and state management.
- Deployed the app to Netlify for public access.

### Challenges Faced
- Time Constraints: The project was completed within a day, so only the UI and API integration were prioritized.

- API Integration: Handling the Gemini API responses and updating the UI efficiently required proper state management.
